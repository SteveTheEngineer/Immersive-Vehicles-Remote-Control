# Immersive Vehicles Remote Control
This mod lets you link an Immersive Vehicles vehicle to a special block that you can interface with using an OpenComputers computer to control the vehicle remotely. The block currently has infinite range, but this might get changed in the future. To link a vehicle it must be either not owned, owned by you or you must have the **ivremotecontrol.force** permission node.\
\
There are also interface blocks, for example the fuel pump interface lets you control the connected pump using a computer.
